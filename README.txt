MyTimes 6-File System
===================

Run:
    pip install streamlit pandas numpy openpyxl pulp plotly
    streamlit run app.py

Files:
1. app.py               Main Streamlit app and workflow
2. config_styles.py     Constants and interface CSS
3. ui_components.py     Hero, KPI cards and reusable UI components
4. data_utils.py        File reading, cleaning, preparation, export helpers
5. optimizer.py         Fair KS optimizer and output builder
6. emergency_engine.py  Emergency reallocation engine with repeated log support

Workflow:
1. Upload Files
2. Data Validation
3. Class Manager
4. Run Fair KS Allocation
5. Emergency Reallocation
6. Manual Fine Tuning
7. Executive Dashboard and Export

Important logic:
- UI wording is English.
- System uses KS terminology.
- Fair allocation follows individual Minimum KS and Maximum KS.
- Emergency Reallocation does not rerun the main optimizer.
- Multiple emergency cases are appended into Emergency Log.
- Manual Fine Tuning allows human adjustment after the optimizer and updates the workload chart.
